# 🌸 Internship Task 1 – Iris Dataset Visualization

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this task was to explore and visualize the famous Iris dataset using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. This task focused on understanding feature relationships and class differences through plots.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset
- **Source:** Built-in dataset from Seaborn
- **Features:** Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- **Target:** Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following visualizations were performed:
1. **Scatter Plot:** Petal length vs petal width by species
2. **Histogram:** Sepal length distribution
3. **Box Plot:** Sepal width grouped by species

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Setosa** flowers are clearly separated in petal dimensions.
- **Virginica** and **Versicolor** have overlapping features but still show trends.
- Sepal width varies more than petal width across species.

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 🗂️ Files
- `INTERNSHIP TASK 1.ipynb` – Contains all the code and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project summary

## ✅ Status
Completed and uploaded as part of internship Task 1.
